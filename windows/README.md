h5r-windows
===========

An environment for building h5r dependencies on windows 7+. Please check out
Makefile for more information. In short, this build requires Rtools31.exe from
CRAN project and MSYS from mingw32 project. 

The building steps for h5r packages will be added back once the testing is
complete. You might also need latest R installed and miktex, if the information
becomes available.
